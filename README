K3MEM
=====

A simple tool to read and write the memories of an Elecraft K3 transceiver.

Disclaimer
==========

This program is not endorsed by Elecraft. We analyzed the communications and 
got an educated guess at how to use the direct EEPROM access commands.

While we have not damaged our transceivers so far by developing this program, 
we can't guarantee that we don't end up writing in the wrong part of the EEPROM
and make a brick of the transceiver. 

Please also note that this is NOT an attempt at reverse engineering the whole 
firmware of the radio, nor an attempt at producing an open source firmware for it.

Documentation
=============

A few sparse notes under docs/

- k3-er.html : what we have figured out so far of the communication protocol
- allMem     : debug output from the official windows program

The other files are random notes and tests of little general value.


Working notes
=============

Stream:
		the string of data that we get from the ER command

Record:
		a fixed-length piece of stream that represents some data
